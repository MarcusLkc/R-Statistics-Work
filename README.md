# R-Statistics-Work
Course Work During The Fall 2017 Semester Programming with R
All R commands and Explananations are held within the PDFS of the folders

Statistics 3155:
Regression and Forecasting Models for Business Applications:
Covered Topics:
Correlation and Regression, Inference for Regression, Multiple Regression,
Building Multiple Regression Models, Time Series Analysis. All work was done using R.]
This class helped build my fundamental theoretical understanding of Statistics and how to choose the correct models to use.

Statistics 3920:
Data Mining
Taught us topics on exploring, cleaning and visualizing data using R while learning about varios Computer Science algorithms and functions for
data processing.
Topics Covered Include:
Exploring Yahoo Stock Data, Mean Squared Forecasting Error, K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, Naive Bayes Classification,
Logistic Regression, Cross Validation, Bias, Bias Variance Measures and Bias Variance Trade Off.

For the Final Project of this class I decided to create a research paper based on Unsupervised Learning Using K-Nearest Neighbors
since machine learning is a topic I am very interested in. It was a fun experience learning about this topic and the algorithms
behind it.
